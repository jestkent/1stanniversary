                <small>June 6, 2024</small>
                <p>
I remember seeing you for the first time and thinking... she’s the same, but somehow something feels different. 
You made me feel something I hadn’t felt in a long time, my heart beating fast, butterflies in my stomach. 
Sometimes I catch myself staring at you when you’re not looking and asking, Why did I ever let this beautiful person go? That moment felt like the start of everything. 
After our baking date, I kept thinking, I really like you... what if we could make this work? I’ve been hoping for another date after my vacation in the province. 
Honestly, I wanted to ask if you’d come with me in my province, but I realized it might be too soon. 
Then you messaged me saying you wanted to go to Enchanted, and I was genuinely so happy.

                <small>June 21, 2024</small>
                <p>Our date at Enchanted was magical.
I was so nervous, but you made me feel completely at ease. My favorite part was when we went to the horror house, I saw you scared, so natural, no filters, just you being you.
I love you for always being yourself.

The rides were thrilling, but the feeling I’ll always remember is how I felt when I was with you.

From our car ride going there, to the extreme rides, seeing you puke (even though you tried to hide it from me but my eyes were on you every second, so sorry, you couldn’t hide),
 to getting soaked on that ride, I forgot its name! and taking a ton of pictures, all the way to going back to Pasay… I really loved it.

                <p>Sitting beside you, laughing with messy hands, and creating something from nothing… it reminded me how beautiful it is to just be in the moment with you.
I’ll always remember the way we looked at each other when the clay wobbled and the way your smile made everything else melt away. 
It wasn’t about making the perfect piece, it was about making memories with you. 
Thank you for making me experience things I have never experienced before. Looking forward for more pottery dates.</p>

                <p>Meeting your parents was one of the scariest but happiest moments of my life. 
                    I was scared that they wouldn’t accept me or might say something negative about me. But after meeting them, I realized they are the kindest parents I’ve ever met. 
                    I was so happy that day, not just because I met your parents, but also because we made our relationship official to both of our families. I know now that I am at peace.

                    Thank you for supporting my interests and joining me in something I truly enjoy.
Every shot felt priceless that day, but what made it unforgettable was sharing it with you.

                <p>December was truly a bittersweet month for me in 2024. Even though I was devastated by what happened, we still managed to do the things we love our dates.

Thank you for the memorable and fun times we had in Tagaytay. Thank you for the countless photobooth moments we shared, and the rides we enjoyed together. I really miss holding your hand and your sweetest kisses.

Most importantly, spending Christmas with your family was the best gift. I was genuinely happy to experience Christmas with them. I’m also so happy to spend New Year’s with you, my love.

Being with you during the New Year was so satisfying. I remember that day, staring at you, thinking in my mind that I want to spend many more New Years with you.</p>

                <p>
To be honest, I don't want to go back here in the US because my happiness is in the Philippines. But the reality is I need to work for our future.

My love, I am so in love with you even though we are in an LDR. I am so happy that we made it 1st anniversary as BF/GF. One more year and we will be together, my love. I promise that.

For now, let's save and save so that after a year, we will just enjoy and make up for those LDR days where we wanted to have a date but we can't. Those days that we wanted to travel and eat delicious foods but we can't.

My love, I love you so much. Please know I will never cheat on you because I see you as my wife in the future, and I don't want anyone else.
