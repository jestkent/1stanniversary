                <small>June 6, 2024</small>
                <p>
I remember seeing you for the first time and thinking... she’s the same, but somehow something feels different. 
You made me feel something I hadn’t felt in a long time, my heart beating fast, butterflies in my stomach. 
Sometimes I catch myself staring at you when you’re not looking and asking, Why did I ever let this beautiful person go? That moment felt like the start of everything. 
After our baking date, I kept thinking, I really like you... what if we could make this work? I’ve been hoping for another date after my vacation in the province. 
Honestly, I wanted to ask if you’d come with me in my province, but I realized it might be too soon. 
Then you messaged me saying you wanted to go to Enchanted, and I was genuinely so happy.

                <small>June 21, 2024</small>
                <p>Our date at Enchanted was magical.
I was so nervous, but you made me feel completely at ease. My favorite part was when we went to the horror house, I saw you scared, so natural, no filters, just you being you.
I love you for always being yourself.

The rides were thrilling, but the feeling I’ll always remember is how I felt when I was with you.

From our car ride going there, to the extreme rides, seeing you puke (even though you tried to hide it from me but my eyes were on you every second, so sorry, you couldn’t hide),
 to getting soaked on that ride, I forgot its name! and taking a ton of pictures, all the way to going back to Pasay… I really loved it.
